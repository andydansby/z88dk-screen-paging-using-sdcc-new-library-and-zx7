# z88dk-screen-paging-using-sdcc-new-library-and-zx7
Page flipping on a standard 48K spectrum.  Uncompressing images on the fly and displaying them.

This code is more of a simple breakdown of a function using the new C library.  
Using SDCC and the new library produces smaller and faster code in Z88dk.

Coding style is different than with the classic library, but not difficult to refactor.

Must use Z88dk version 1.99C

Place these files in a seperate directory and run the command "COMPILE" to build.
